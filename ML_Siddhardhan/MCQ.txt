1. In Supervised Learning, the Machine Learning model is trained with?
Labelled Data

Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.

2. What are the different types of tasks in Supervised Learning (2 correct answers)
Regression
Classification

A classification algorithm may predict a continuous value, but the continuous value is in the form of a probability for a class label. A regression algorithm may predict a discrete value, but the discrete value in the form of an integer quantity.


3. A Machine Learning model can predict the salary of a person, given his/her work experience. This is an example of ?
Regression 

Since salary is a continuous value ( & not discrete), it is an example of Regression.
